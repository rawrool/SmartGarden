# Smartproject
<h1>What is the project about:</h1>
<p> The Resilient Smart Garden will benefit California that is in the midst of a drought; 
this is a problem because California is the most valuable land for crops. Every drop of water is precious and the farming 
process could use some help with optimizing its water use. Too much watering is just wasting this limited 
resource and underwatering kills plants or renders them unable to produce maximum crop production.
</p>

<p>
Our Resilient Smart Garden will help to ensure vegetable plants are not over or under watered. It will 
find the water balance to grow the perfect vegetable. It also takes the mandatory watering out of the 
users hands and automates watering based on the moisture of the soil.
</p>

<p>
The Smart Garden will take moisture and temperature readings to decide if the garden needs more water. 
These readings will be stored in a database that is accessible online and can be accessed through the web or 
iOS at the moment. The data can be used to further research on the best watering method that fits for different kinds of plants.
