            <p>
                Our embedded system is a resilient smart garden capable of self watering and assisted remote monitoring. Here in California
                we’re in the midst of a drought; which becomes a problem when we have so much farming. Every drop of water
                is precious and the farming process could use some help with optimizing its water use. Too much watering
                is just wasting this limited resource and underwatering kills plants or renders them unable to produce maximum
                crop production.
            </p>
            <p>Our Resilient Smart Garden will help to ensure vegetable plants are not over or under watered. It will find the
                water balance to grow the perfect vegetable. It also takes the mandatory watering out of the users hands
                and automates watering based on the moisture of the soil.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Smart Garden will take moisture and temperature readings to decide if the garden needs more water. These readings will
                be stored in a database that is accessible online and can be accessed through pc or mobile smartphone. The
                data can be used to further research on the best watering method that fits for different kinds of plants.

                Hardware
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Arduino Board functions as the brain of the whole system. Using the WiFi Shield the Arduino Board can communicate with
                the online server to record a user’s garden as well as to control the other components connected to the Arduino.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few of the important components the Arduino Board is connected to are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Humidity and temperature sensor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Soil moisture sensor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Water solenoid valve
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Both the temperature sensor and soil moisture sensor, allows users to record the reading, so that they may be displayed later.
                The water solenoid valve functions properly when connected to an outdoor water faucet and a 12v power supply.

            </h1>
            <p>
                To install the WiFi shield you must first solder on headers so that it stacks on top of the Arduino Board.

            <h1>How to use the IOS App</h1>
            <h2>Garden Tab</h2>
            <p>
                This tab is the default view when the application is launched. Refer to the picture below for this section. It shows the
                title that is set for the plant currently in the garden centered at the top of the screen. Shown underneath
                the title is the garden’s current temperature, humidity, and when the last time the garden was watered. At
                the bottom of the screen, there is a button titled “Garden Details”. This button will take you to a screen
                that displays how much water and electricity the garden has used that day.
            </p>
            <img src="screenshot1.png" alt="garden_tab">
            <h2>Search Tab</h2>
            <p>
                This tab displays the garden’s database entries that are between the two dates in the text fields at the top of the screen.
                Refer to the picture below for this section. When each text field is tapped, a date picker wheel appears.
                Simply select the start date in the left text field, and the end date in the right text field. The application
                will connect to the server and display all the garden’s database entries between the start and end date.
                When you tap on an entry, you will be taken to the “Garden Details” screen, mentioned in the “Garden Tab”
                section of this manual, except the data will be for that database entry.
            </p>
            <img src="screenshot2.png" alt="search_tab">
            <h2>Settings Tab</h2>
            <p>
                This tab has three buttons on the screen: Select the data you want recorded, Set a water schedule, Create a water schedule.
            </p>
            <img src="screenshot3.png" alt="settings_tab">
            <p>
                The “Select the data you want recorded” button brings you to the screen shown below. Each entry in the table has a switch
                on the right side to turn it on or off. When the switch is flipped to the right, with the green showing on
                the left side of the switch, it is considered on. When the switch is on, that setting is being recorded to
                the database from your garden daily. When the switch is off, that setting is not being recorded from your
                garden.
            </p>
            <img src="screenshot4.png" alt="settings_2">
            <p>
                The “Set a water schedule” button brings you to the screen that is shown below. The water schedules you have created are
                shown here in a table view. Each schedule has a switch on the right of the title of it. Only one schedule
                may be active at a time so only one switch can be in the on position at a time. To switch to a different
                schedule simply tap the switch of the schedule you want to set and it will turn on and switch to that schedule.
                If you tap on one of the schedules it will bring you to the screen described in “Create a water schedule”.
            </p>

            <p>
                The “Create a water schedule” button brings you to the screen that is shown below. In this screen you set the name of the
                schedule, starting time for watering, duration of watering, and how often you want the watering to repeat.
                Tapping the “Save” button, upper right corner of the screen, will save the schedule and set it to your current
                watering schedule then bring you back to the “Settings Tab” screen.
