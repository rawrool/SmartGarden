                    <p>The resilient smart garden will help us out here in California where we’re in the midst of a drought;
                        which becomes a problem when we have so much farming. Every drop of water is precious and the farming
                        process could use some help with optimizing its water use. Too much watering is just wasting this
                        limited resource and underwatering kills plants or renders them unable to produce maximum crop production.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our Resilient Smart Garden will help to ensure vegetable plants are not over or under watered. It will
                        find the water balance to grow the perfect vegetable. It also takes the mandatory watering out of
                        the users hands and automates watering based on the moisture of the soil.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Smart Garden will take moisture and temperature readings to decide if the garden needs more water.
                        These readings will be stored in a database that is accessible online and can be accessed through
                        pc or mobile smartphone. The data can be used to further research on the best watering method that
                        fits for different kinds of plants.

                    What are the features:
                </h1>
                <h2>App Features</h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile and web app will come with 3 key features: checking garden logs, creating garden watering schedules, 
                    and sharing garden data with other people. When choosing to look up garden logs you can search by date, then 
                    select the specific log from the list of logs recorded for that day, and have the log displayed on your screen. 
                    Creating a garden watering schedule is an ease by simply typing in a name for it and choosing the desired time to 
                    water, duration time, and the option whether to have the schedule repeated daily. A user can also choose to share 
                    any of their recorded logs, watering schedules, or their plant's progress. When choosing to share their data 
                    through the mobile app a user is allowed to share their data through different means of communication like SMS, 
                    email, or social media.
                </p>
                <h2>Arduino Features</h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduino Uno Rev3 Board was chosen for this project because it is one of the most used and popular boards 
                    available for projects of various complexities. It also doesn't require much power and can be powered through 
                    usb, AC-to-DC power adapter, or a battery adapter. Another main features of the board is that it has 14 digital
                    input/output pins and 6 analog pins meaning that it can be equiped with various other components like a WiFi shield,
                    different sensors, or even other boards. Some of the features that we use from the Adruino Board for this project 
                    are the ability to easily stack other boards on top, for example a WiFi Shield for connecting the Arduino to a 
                    WiFi network. Another feature that we are taking advantage of is the number of input/output pins, which we are using 
                    to connect multiple sensors at the same time. Lastly, the Arduino Board has the ability to also provide enough power 
                    to power different components for this project we didn't need any additional power source besides the one that is 
                    powering the board itself.

                    What are the components:
                </h1>
                <h2>Hardware Required</h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduino Board is one of the primary hardware required for this project because it is what connects the 
                    various other components together and functions kind of like the human brain. It is capable of communicating
                    with the components connected and allows the user reprogram the board with ease. There is also other published 
                    project tutorials that are well documented and can be referenced to replicate the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WiFi Shield is another primary hardware required because it is what actually allows the Arduino Board 
                    to connect to an online connection through WiFi. The shield also has the capability to be stacked on top 
                    of the board, so that it is powered directly through the board without any additional cables and still 
                    provide access to the board's input/output pins. We will be using the shield to publish our data onto an 
                    online database and allow the user to control the Arduino Board online. We chose the SparkFun WiFi Shield 
                    because the manufacturer provides great documentation and examples online. However, you will need to solder 
                    on the stackable headers yourself and a 2.4 GHz Antenna with a U.FL connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other primary hardware required are the soil moisture sensor and the temperature and humidity sensor. 
                    These sensors provide data feed that will be used to monitor the environmental conditions of the user's 
                    garden. The sensors are both connected directly to a breadboard and the breadboard connected to the 
                    Arduino Board through jumper cables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last hardware required is the water solenoid valve. The valve will be used to control the flow of
                    water. The valve also required a power source of 12v, unfortunately the Arduino Board can only provide 
                    up to 5v. Therefore, we will need to use a TIP120 transistor, a 1k Ohm resistor, and a diode to provide 
                    enough power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An optional hardware piece is the LCD module. We chose to use one because it allows us to display data
                    directly to the LCD screen module for debugging purposes.
